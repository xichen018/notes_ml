##### Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data via data mining techniques. These features can be used to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. Feature engineering can be considered as applied machine learning itself 

- The feature engineering process is:
  - Brainstorming or testing features;
  - Deciding what features to create;
  - Creating features;
  - Checking how the features work with your model;
  - Improving your features if needed;
  - Go back to brainstorming/creating more features until the work is done.
